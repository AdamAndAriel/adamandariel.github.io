Ariel’s best friend from college will be getting married near their college in Bryn Mawr! This was Ariel and Adam’s first trip across the country together ✈️

The first stop was a reunion with another one of Ariel’s best friends, Eunsoo and her husband Walker.

We all went to visit Bryn Mawr College on the day of thanksgiving (it was totally empty and we could only get into one building…) But we got to see the outside of Ariel’s old “home”, the psychology building Bettys-coed!

Adam thought Bryn Mawr has a beautiful campus. (He said it looked a lot nicer than Vanderbilt)

It was super windy and cold. Brrr….. Typical Philly.

We went to the market near city hall in downtown Philly, and took some cute photos.

And then there was the Wedding Day~

The venue was a lovely small venue near Philadelphia. Ariel and Eunsoo were both bridesmaids, so they had to read speeches, and also what non-weather appropriate dresses for the ceremony….

Here is a photo of Abby, Ariel and Eunsoo

The ceremony was very intimate and moving (Ariel cried). Adam and Ariel took really, really nice pictures. Don’t they look so cute!!!!
