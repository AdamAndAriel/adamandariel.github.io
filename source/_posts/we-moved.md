We've moved! 🏠✨ (or should we say Adam moved into Ariel's apartment 🚚💕)

After weeks of searching and packing, we've finally settled into our apartment. We figured it's time to let go of the apartment Adam was renting at Shoreline, and move in with Ariel~ 🏢❤️.

The only available unit in Ariel's building was a 3b2b, so we took it. But there's only two of us!! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ We now have a master bedroom, a study room (and also a tea room), and a gym. Pretty dope, huh! 💪🍵 And there's so much space for our beautiful plants 🌿 and for Minnie 🐾 to patrol around.

Moving was EXHAUSTING 😓, but we are almost done! Stay tuned for snippets of our home-making journey! 🏡✨

Ps: The weather has been horrific these past few weeks ☔🌬️, so we didn't even know we have amazing views in the new apartment. Until a few days ago when Adam woke up and saw Rainier Mountain from our kitchen window, glowing in the rising sun 🌄, it was magnificent! Here's the photo I took. Dope as hell, right? 🏞️📸)

Cheers to new beginnings,
Adam and Ariel 🥂💖
