Today Cathy and Brian came as the first guests of the new apartment. It was no longer a mess 😆

Everyone made a dish:

Cathy made stir fry tofu🍲
Adam made his signature 红烧排骨🥘
Ariel stir fried some vegetables because all the other dishes were meat heavy🥗 
We were going to make dumplings (got all the ingredients but ended up not making it because we were too hungry!!!)🥟
Brian made fried chicken wings (with the new air fryer, and it kept setting off the fire alarm)🍗
<!-- ![Delicious Dinner Zoomed In!](/images/food/house-warming-dinner-home-cooked-zoomed-in.jpg) --!>

By the time we got to eating, it was super late (8-9 PM?) but it was DELICIOUS!!

After dinner we played video games (or actually, Adam and Brian played 2k while Ariel and Cathy got increasingly more bored). We decided to play a little bit of It Takes Two. Cathy and Brian tried one of the earlier chapters with the help of Adam and Ariel explaining it like a walkthrough 😂

What a fun day 🥳🍲🍜🥘🥟
