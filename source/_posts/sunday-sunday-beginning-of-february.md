Today was sunny so we went downtown (nothing else to doâ€¦..?)

Adam knocked over my reed diffuser a couple months ago back before we moved, so we went to Pike Place first and got another new one (for my bathroom, not the boy bathroom)

Afterwards, we decided to go on the Ferris wheel for the first time ðŸŽ¡ even though we have been passing it by for months.

Honestly, it was wobblier than I thought and I was starting to get motion sickness. I kept reminding Adam to stop moving around ðŸ˜‚

He was very invested in taking a good photo (not super successful)(except this one)

After the Ferris wheel we were feeling adventurous so we also went to the Seattle/Bainbridge ferry terminal. It was actually too cold and we didnâ€™t want to go on the island but I just wanted to go on the ferry.

I think problems always seem smaller when Iâ€™m on the oceanâ€¦ ðŸŒŠ

By the time we got back it was already dark.

One more week before Rayson (the car)ðŸš˜ is fixed and Adam can finally be a car-owner again ðŸ˜† to be honest we already donâ€™t remember what it was like with a car. When it comes down to it, we donâ€™t actually need to drive around in the city that much; itâ€™s all accessible by public transport. 

It was a nice day. Itâ€™s good to take a break from staying indoors all week working and studyingðŸ¤“
